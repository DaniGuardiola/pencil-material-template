# Pencil Material Design Template
A material design template for [Pencil, the open source prototyping tool for Windows, Mac, Linux and Firefox](https://github.com/evolus/pencil) (HTML export template)

> **Note:** I'm no longer supporting this template. I think it doesn't work anymore with the latest versions of Pencil. As such, this repo is archived. Feel free to contact me if you want to send a pull request or become a maintainer and I'll unarchive it.
